# Storke-Prediction
This repository contains the notebook and dataset which was taken from kagggle. This dataset contains 11 clinical features, through which we have to build a prediction model.
I am still working in this project so there may be some changes in Notebook in future.

How to run this notebook:
<br>
1. Download the Dataset and the Code file.
2. Keep both of the files in same folder or change the directory of file in the code.
3. Run the codes (Make sure all the libraies are downloaded in your jupyter notebook's environment).

Note : Your sepcific resutls may vary given the stochastic nature of the learning algorithm, the evaluation procedure, or differences in numerical precision. Consider running the example a few times and compare the average performance.
